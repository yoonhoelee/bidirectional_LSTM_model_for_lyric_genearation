always meant to be destiny all before the same old night love seok 0 august year can anyone remember the moment they fall in love can anyone predict the moment their love will end what could be the reason that humans dont have the ability to recognize those moments and why was i given the power to return all of those things the car came to a sudden stop the headlights flash crashing bouncing falling i did nothing but stand defenseless in the face of all of those moments i heard no sound and felt no sensations it was summer but the wind seemed cold there was the sound of something tumbling along the street then there was the scent of flowers only then did a sense of reality come to me the bouquet of smeraldo flowers fell from my hand she was laying there in the middle of the street there was blood flowing in between the strands of her hair the dark red blood flowers along the street i thought if only i could turn back time seok july year 0 past the school doors the sound of cicadas prickled my ears the school yard was crowded with kids laughing and playing and competing in races it was the start of summer vacation and everyone was chattering i ducked my head and walked in between them i wanted to leave as quickly as i could hyung i lifted my head surprised by the sudden appearance of someones shoulder it was hoseok and they looked at me their smiles as wide and bright as ever and their eyes full of mischief today is the start of vacation are you still going to leave hoseok asked tugging at my a i muttered sure and a few more meaningless words then turned my head away what had happened that day was clearly an accident it wasnt intentional i hadnt imagined that and yoongi would be in the storage room at that time the principal suspected that i was covering for my dangsaengs i had to say something but in the end yoongi had gotten expelled nobody knew that i had been the complicit have a good vacation hyung ill call you maybe having interpreted my expression hoseok let his hand drop slightly and forced an even brighter greeting i couldnt answer this time either there was nothing i could say as i passed the school gate i thought of the first day i had come to this school we had all been punished for tardiness together we could laugh because of it i had ruined these moments yoongi 5 june year i wasn't aware of anything other than the sound of music playing in my head not how much i had drunk nor where i was nor what i had been doing i didnt know and it wasnt important when i went outside stumbling it was already night i swayed as i walked i bumped into pedestrians news kiosks walls i didnt care i just wanted to forget everything s voice was still ringing in my ears hyung my next memory was of running like crazy up the hospital steps the hospital hall had been strangely long and dark i passed people wearing hospital gowns my heart pounded everyones faces were too pale they had no expressions they all seemed like dead people the sound of my breathing was harsh inside my own head inside the slightly opened hospital room door was lying there i turned my head without realizing it i couldnt look at him at that moment i suddenly heard the sound of a piano of flames of a building crumbling down i clutched my head and sank down this is your fault if it wasnt for you it was my mothers voice no my voice no someones voice at those words i was toented by countless moments i wanted to believe it wasnt so but was lying there was lying in a hall full of corpse like patients passing by i was utterly unable to go inside i couldnt check for myself when i stood my legs threatened to give out i left with tears flowing it was funny i couldnt even remember the last time i had cried i went to cross the street but someone grabbed my a and i came to a halt who was it no i didnt care no matter who it was it was all the same dont come near me go away just leave me be i dont want to hurt you either i dont want to be hurt so please dont come any closer yoongi june year 9 i thoughtlessly ditched school but truthfully i didnt have anywhere to go it was hot i had no money and i had nothing to do it was namjoon who said we should go to the beach the younger kids seemed excited but i didnt particularly feel like it nor did i dislike the idea do we have money at my question namjoon made everyone shake out their pockets a few coins a few bills so we cant go the one who said we could just walk was probably taehyung namjoon made a face begging them to reconsider but the kids just chattered away laughing and pretending to roll around on the road before starting to walk i wasnt in the mood to talk back so i just fell behind it was midday so even the gingko trees couldnt provide shade and the cars kicked up dust as they passed us on the sidewalkless road lets go there it was taehyung this time too or was it hoseok i didnt care so i didnt look carefully but it would have been one of them i had been walking along with my head down kicking dirt when i almost collided with someone i lifted my head was standing there as if frozen in place the muscles in his face trembled as if had seen something terrifying he was staring at a sign that said flowering arboretum kilometers i didnt want to walk i heard s voice sweat dripped from s face he went pale as if he might collapse at any second what is it i had a strange feeling park i called but as i expected he didnt budge i lifted my head again and looked at the sign hey its so hot why would we go to an arboretum lets go to the beach i said as if dragging my feet i didnt know what kind of place the arboretum was but it didnt seem like we should go whatever the reason s expression was strange we dont even have money hoseok replied thats why were walking and taehyung added if we just walk to the train station we can probably make it then namjoons said instead well just starve at dinner and taehyung pretended to cry and seok hyung laughed only started to move again once it was decided that we would take the road toward the train station walking with his head down and his shoulders trembling seemed like a small child i looked up at the sign again the characters spelling flowering arboretum were gradually getting further away namjoon july year i rested my head against the bus window from the library to the gas station the scenery passed by the window almost frighteningly familiar since i took this route everyday would there come a day i could leave this scenery behind i felt that it was impossible to predict what tomorrow would bring nor to hope for anything there was a woman sitting in front of me her hair tied with a yellow rubber band her shoulders lifted and then dropped as if she was sighing then she rested her head against the window for around a month already we had studied at the same library and gotten on the bus at the same stop we hadnt spoken a word to each other but we looked at the same scenery and lived on the same time and sighed the same sighs the hair tie was still in my pants pocket the woman always got off the bus three stops before i did every time i saw her leave i wondered if she was going to distribute fliers what kind of time was she spending what kind of things was she enduring how strongly did she feel stifled at the thought that tomorrow might not come or that from the beginning there had never been such a thing as tomorrow i thought things like that the womans stop began to approach someone pressed the stop request button and other passengers stood up from their seats but in the midst of this that woman didnt stir she just stayed in her seat her head against the window it seemed like she was asleep should i go and wake her i fought with myself for a moment the bus approached the stop the woman didnt move people disembarked the door closed and the bus started to move the woman didnt wake even as we passed the next three stops as i moved to the bus door i fought with myself again it was clear that once i got off the bus no one else would pay attention to her she would wake up somewhere far from her stop and it was impossible to know how much more tired she would be today because of it i left the bus stop and started to walk toward the gas station the bus took off and i didnt look back i had left the hair tie on top of her bag but that was it that wasnt a beginning and as such nor was it an end it was nothing to start with and there was no reason for it to be anything so i thought it really didnt matter namjoon 7 december year the people waiting for the bus rubbed their hands together in the cold i looked down at the dirt clutching the strap of my bag i was trying to not make eye contact with anyone it was a countryside village where only two buses stopped per day from a distance i saw the first bus approaching i boarded the bus behind everyone else i didnt look back when i was passionate about something when i barely had something in my grasp when i had nothing left but things to escape i had conditions i wasnt to look back the moment i looked back the efforts id made until now became little more than seafoam looking back that was a kind of suspicion a kind of lingering attachment and a kind of fear only when i had overcome these things could i finally escape the bus started off i had no plans i had nothing i was passionate about nothing in my group no particular reason to escape it was closer to thoughtlessly running away from my mothers tired face my wandering sibling my fathers illness starting with the situation in our house that grew more difficult with every passing day from my family who enforced sacrifice and tranquility and from me who pretended to know nothing and restrained myself from trying to adjust and grow resigned but most of all it was closer to running from poverty if anyone asked if its a crime to be poor everyone would say its not but is that really the truth poverty gnaws on so many things things that were precious become meaningless you give up things you cant give up you grow suspicious and fearful and resigned the bus would arrive at a familiar stop in a few hours when i left from that place a year ago i had left no message behind and now i was returning with no sign or warning i tried to recall my friends faces i had cut off contact with all of them what were they all doing these days would they be glad to see me would we be able to get together and laugh the way we had back then there was frost on the windows and i couldnt see the scenery outside on top of the frost i slowly moved my finger i have to survive hoseok 4 july year i stood in the hallway the whole time she was receiving first aid even though it was night the hospital hallway was bustling with people moisture dripped from my hair wet with sweat and rain i dropped the bag i had taken off of her a variety of things tumbled out of it a few coins rolled away and a ball pen and a towel in the middle of it all was an airplane eticket i picked it up and scanned it at that moment the doctor called me he said it was a mild concussion and nothing to worry about and after a moment she came out as well are you okay she said that her head just hurt a little and she took her bag from me then she spotted the eticket peeking out and looked up at my face i shifted my bag to my other shoulder and said that we should go pretending that it was nothing as we left the hospital it was raining as hard as ever we stood side by side outside the door hoseokah she said it looked like she had something to say wait a second ill get an umbrella i ran off thoughtlessly into the rain there was a convenience store in the distance i knew that she had auditioned for an overseas dance team some time ago the plane ticket meant that she had made it i didnt want to hear her say it i didnt have the confidence to congratulate her hoseok july year 0 when i counted to three i heard the sound of laughter like a hallucination the next moment the young me passed by holding someones hand i looked back quickly but there was no one there except my classmates staring at me hoseokah the teacher called my name only then did i realize where i was it was a class field trip i was counting the fruits that were drawn in the textbook five six i kept counting but as i did my voice trembled and my hands grew sweaty the memory of that time kept surfacing i couldnt clearly remember my mothers face that day i only remembered the chocolate bar she gave me as we looked around the amusement park hoseokah count to ten and then open your eyes when i had finished counting and opened my eyes my mother was gone i waited and waited but she never returned i had only counted to nine if i counted one more it would have been fine but my voice wouldnt come out my ears were ringing and my surroundings grew cloudy the teacher kept pointing telling me to keep counting my friends were staring at me i couldnt remember my mothers face it seemed like if i counted one more my mother would really never come back for me just like that i collapsed to the ground 4 july year by the time i returned to my senses i had washed my a so much that i was losing skin my hands were trembling and i was short of breath my eyes were bloodshot what had just happened came back to me in fragments for a moment i had lost focus i was dancing with a noona from the dance club a collaborative dance but i had lost my flow and we collided i fell to the rough floor and my a started to bleed at that moment i had remembered what happened at the flowering arboretum i thought that i had overcome it but that wasnt the case i had to run away i had to wash it away i had to look away the me in the mirror was the same eightyearold kid who had run away in the rain then all at once i realized noona had fallen down too there was nothing i could do all i could do was fall and hurt someone leave them behind and tremble at my own pain only to run after them too late with an umbrella before stopping every time i took a step rainwater soaked my sneakers car headlights passes me by it wasnt okay no it was okay it didnt hurt it wasnt that serious of an injury i was really okay 9 may year in the end i had to go to the flowering arboretum i had quit telling myself the lie that i didnt remember what happened there i had to stop living in hiding in the hospital and stop having seizures if i wanted to do that i had to go to the place with that intent i went to the bus stop every day but i couldnt ride the bus to the arboretum yoongi hyung came and sat next to me after id already let three buses go by i asked what was up and hyung said he was bored and had nothing to do then he asked why i was sitting here like this i thought about why i was sitting here like this it was because i had no courage i wanted to pretend i was okay now that i knew a little that i surpassed it on my own but in truth i was afraid i was afraid that i might encounter something that i might not withstand that i might have another seizure yoongi hyung looked relaxed he slumped down like had not a thing in the world to worry him and said that the weather was nice said all kinds of useless things after i heard that i realized the weather really was nice i had been so worried that i didnt bother looking at my surroundings the sky was so blue a wa breeze blew on occasion from far off the shuttle bus for the arboretum was coming the bus stopped and the door opened the driver looked at me on impulse i spoke hyung do you want to come with me taehyung 7 july year my side hurt so badly it seemed to be tearing sweat fell in drops in the nooks and crannies of the railroad in the vacant lot behind the convenience store under the overpass the girl was nowhere to be found i had even run to the bus stop but as expected i didnt see her the people waiting for their buses looked at me strangely what had happened we hadnt promised to meet but it was still strange that girl always appeared from somewhere and followed me around even if i told her it was annoying it was no use but now she was nowhere to be found even in the places we used to go together i came to a familiar wall and slowed my steps there was graffiti there we had drawn together it was the first thing she had ever drawn on top of it there was a large x drawn it was her i hadnt seen her do it but i knew why there was no response instead several after images overlapped on the wall her laughing at me after i had lain down on the railroad tracks and hit my head her helping me up after id fallen trying to help her run away her angry expression when we passed in front of a photo studio with a family photo in the window her gaze following the students we passed by unbeknownst even to her as we had sprayed this wall together i had said if you have a problem tell me about it dont just grumble to yourself the x was drawn over all of those memories it seemed like it was saying all of it was fake i had made my hands into fists why of course there was no response i kept walking we were alone again me and her taehyung 0 march year 0 i slid down the hallway my feet making noisy sounds then i stopped i could see namjoon standing in front of our classroom our classroom nobody knew this but i called that place our classroom me and the hyungs and it was ours i caught my breath and approached i was going to startle them principal i had barely taken five steps when i head an urgent voice through the open classroom window it seemed like seok hyung i stopped walking was seok hyung talking to the principal right now in our classroom why then i heard my name and yoongi hyungs and i saw namjoon hyung draw in a startled breath as if having sensed it seok hyung suddenly opened the door there was a phone in seok hyungs hand his shock and confusion was plain on his face i couldnt see namjoon hyungs expression i hid and watched seok hyung looked confused hyung must have had a reason after he spoke namjoon hyung passed by seok hyung and went into the classroom i couldnt believe it seok hyung told the principal what yoongi hyung and i had done for the last several days he told everything about skipping class and climbing over the wall and fighting with other kids but namjoon hyung said that was all okay what are you doing here i turned around in shock it was hoseok hyung and hoseok hyung pretended to be even more shocked then slung his a over my shoulders in a moment of confusion i let hoseok hyung pull me into that classroom namjoon hyung and seok hyung were talking and they looked up seok hyung got up in a hurry and said something had come up he left the classroom i looked at namjoon hyungs expression he had watched seok hyungs retreating back but now he laughed as if nothing was wrong at that moment a thought occurred to me namjoon hyung must have had a reason because hyung knew more than me and was smarter and older and because this was our classroom i went into the classroom smiling the foolish smile that the others teasingly called my rectangle smile i thought that i wouldnt tell anyone else that i had overheard that conversation 6 july year i sneakily broke a flower off the hospitals wreath i kept laughing and having to bow my head to hide it the midsummer sunlight was blindingly bright i knocked on the hospital room door but there was no reply i knocked again no one was there it was only full of a very quiet darkness i left the hospital room i had met her here when i was bored and stifled and pushing my wheelchair like crazy up and down the hallway she had appeared so suddenly that i barely had time to stop and there she stood a girl with her hair tied up in a ponytail when i left the hospital i saw a bench i remembered we had listened to music together and drawn sitting there i was still holding the wildflower in my hand there was no one to give it to 0 september year 0 jeon youre not still going there are you i didnt answer i just stood there staring at the toes of my shoes when i didnt answer he hit me on the head with the attendance file but even so i didnt open my mouth it was the classroom i used with the hyungs after the day i had followed the hyungs around and we had discovered that classroom there wasnt a single day i hadnt gone maybe the hyungs didnt know sometimes they didnt come because they had other plans or were busy with parttime jobs i hadnt seen either seok hyung or yoongi hyung in a few days but not me i didnt skip a single day there were days when nobody came at all but that's okay even if it wasnt today then they would come tomorrow and if not tomorrow then the day after it was okay you only learned bad things following them around he hit me again i lifted my gaze and looked at him he hit me again the image came to me of yoongi hyung hitting me i gritted my teeth and endured i didnt want to lie and say i hadnt been going now i was standing again in front of that classroom it seemed like the hyungs would be there if i opened the door it seemed like they would look up from the fame they were playing and ask me why i was so late seok hyung and namjoon hyung would be reading books yoongi hyung would be playing the piano and hoseok hyung and hyung would be dancing but when i opened the door only hoseok hyung was there he was cleaning up the things we had left behind in the classroom i held the door handle and just stood there hyung came over and put his a around my shoulders then he led me outside lets go the classroom door closed behind us i suddenly realized those days were gone

black boy we ain't gonna lie to you black boy black boy we don't like the sight of you pull up on the side of you window rolled down 'profile' then we wonder why we see this side of you probably comin' from the dope house we could let you slide but your tail light is blew out we know you're hidin' that heidi klum on you another drug charge homie it's back inside for you and just in case a chase might ensue we got that tried and true pistol drew right at you we'd be delighted to unload it in your back then walk up and lay that taser on the side of you fucked up but what the fuck am i to do i keep tellin' myself keep doin' like you're doin' no matter how many lives you ruin it's for the red white and blue time to go find a new one and split his head right in two no one's ever indicted you why 'cause you're a   eminem  cheech and chong white boy white boy you're a rockstar my momma talkin' to me tryna tell me how to live white boy white boy in your cop car but i don't listen to her 'cause my head is like a sieve white boy white boy you're untouchable the world's coming to an end i don't even care nobody can tell me shit 'cause i'm a big rockstar   black boy black boy we don't get your culture and we don't care what our government's done to fuck you over man don't tell us your attitude's a result of that balderdash whered you get the chip on your shoulder at why you kicking that soda can pull your pants up we 'bout to roll up and throw your ass in the van cuffed you don't have to know our plans or what our intentions are our cards are close to our chest you better show your hands and put our minds more at ease or get shot in the thyroid comply or die boy we're fightin' a crime war here come the swine tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities that's what we call 'em pigsties for they're like eyesores to police talk to you like just a piece of trash feels like we're stuck in a time warp to me as i kick these facts and get these mixed reactions as this beat backspins it's like we're drifting back in to the sixties having black skin is risky 'cause this keeps happening throughout history africanamericans have been treated like shit and i admit there have been times where it's been embarrassin' to be a   eminem  cheech and chong white boy white boy you're a rockstar my momma talkin' to me tryna tell me how to live white boy white boy in your cop car but i don't listen to her 'cause my head is like a sieve white boy white boy you're untouchable the world's coming to an end i don't even care nobody can tell me shit 'cause i'm a big rockstar  pt ii   seems like the average lifespan of a white man is more than twice than a black life span i wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner i feel like checking out on life can't escape this circumstance i'd rather hear 'em say die nword than die antwoord ninja now it's better disguised banter but that's life strapped 'cause we're strapped financially and can't find answers we're applying but mcdonald's seems to be the only franchise that'll hire so how can we have higher standards as dallas overshadows the battle for black lives matter we fight back with violence but acts like that are black eyes on the movement which makes black lives madder at cops and cops madder that's why it's at a stalemate and can't arrive at a compromise so it's black ops i wonder if we hire more black cops the crap stops the block is our backyards officers not the crack spot call the attack dogs off of us man you always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop and bad cops fuck it up for the good cops and man stop sendin' white cops in the black neighborhoods who ain't acclimated to 'em like that's the way to do it who seen some fuckin' videos of rappers waving guns and know nobody black so they act afraid of us and that's racism the fear that a black face gives 'em a subconscious racist wait why are there black neighborhoods 'cause america segregated us designated us to an area separated us sectioneight'd us when we tear it ups the only time attentions paid to us and education sucks and every day's another freddie gray for us a levy breaks or fuzz why is it they treat us like dryer lint we just want a safe environment for our kids but cant escape the sirens dont take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in the poverty that we face so the crime rates the highest in the lowest classes it's like a razor wire fence and were trapped in these racial biases that plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise every time we see a devils face lions tigers and bears oh my it's more like billy clubs and gats and we really love it when you think were guilty cause were black but you kill each other facts you peel each other's caps for silly stuff like hats single mother strugglin through substance abuse while people with nothin' to lose shoot each other for shoes fuck your republican views pull ourselves up by our bootstraps where the fuck are the boots and streets act as a narrator don't gotta read comics or be that into characters just to see that just to be black you better be strapped with a derringer or be capped in america like steve rogers 'cause no one oversees these cops and all we see is 'em beat charges we done seen 'em beat rodney king unconscious and got off so we don't need all you crooked police officers' peace offerings just keep marchin' 'til we reach congress but they're gonna say you're tryin' to take an irrational stance if you try to slander the flag but somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb so they call it a kaepernick tantrum if you don't stand for the national anthem we raise it you better praise it or you'll be made to feel like a traitor we'll treat you like rodney dangerfield home of the brave is still racist 'ville so this whole nation feels like a plantation field in a country that claims that its foundation was based on united states ideals that had its natives killed got you singin' this starspangled spiel to a piece of cloth that represents the land of the free that made people slaves to build verse eminem you know it's devil's night the way that i smash the face of a punk in mask of jason is a fashion statement since drunken master tapes been a basket case and if that's the case then i'm dunkin' fascination with masturbation and humpin' lacerations and masking tape and i'm bumpin' some masta ace roll up posin' as pastor mase at a luncheon see andrea yates grab her face then i'm punchin' crack her fuckin' skull with an antique vase kill her husband to the back of the station wagon she's dragged and placed in the trunk and now i'm wanted for kidnappin' rape and abduction spread her legs like land o'lakes that i'm cuttin' 'til every fuckin' limb's either amputated or punctured decapitated christina applegate and i rap like i'm agitated no chill but i'm half sedated a functioning addict  wait i'm in london brains underwear a pantywaist classic case of disfunction aggravated assault it was rap related you activated a gunman this game's oversaturated with junk and you punks couldn't get a hit from a database with a thumbprint razors and matches path

placid for alligators after i use the fuckin' tire thumper to bash her brains in for nothin' the murder weapons i stash 'em away on runyon man the kind of balls that it has to take and the gumption lack of class displayed but such a vast array in abundance of sad disgraceful and bad distasteful redundance and bitch i'm hung like candy canes if you're wonderin' balls come at you like batting cages i'm raw like big daddy kane is i'm comin' like i'm ejaculatin' and nuttin' come catch the clap like you're pattycakin' lil' dumplin' or brace yourself like a cast and be the last to make an

have to act white if they like red hot chili peppers and whites dont have to act black if they like saltnpepa cause i like a lot of people  mucus on the  so i'm blackened like metallica look at me in shock but nothing else matters wherever i may roam the microphone's my best friend and the stage is my home our music got the sounds our rhythms got the hooks i listen to kenny rogers marvin gaye and garth brooks i listened to that  that's  and  but music is good music the other is mess the  you chocolate and a peppermint what color is my soul here's a hint let's hook 'em"]
